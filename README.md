# Maze-Game

## Description of the project

This project aims to create an interactive game that generates mazes randomly, with the same starting and ending points, where the user can move in four directions to reach the checkpoint. To achieve this, I implemented the well-known **Depth First Search algorithm (DFS)** for the generation of random mazes in the C language.

For the graphical aspect, I used the external library **ncurses**, which allows to visualize the created mazes and execute user commands (moving up, down, left, right) and display the movements on the maze.

## Installation of tools to compile the code

After cloning this project to your local machine, you will need to install a compiler and the ncurses library to launch and play the game.

In a Debian based linux environment, you can install the gcc compiler using the command:

`sudo apt update
 sudo apt install gcc`
