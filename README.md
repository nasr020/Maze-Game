# Maze-Game

## Description of the project

This project aims to create an interactive game that generates mazes randomly, with the same starting and ending points, where the user can move in four directions to reach the checkpoint. To achieve this, I implemented the well-known Depth First Search algorithm (DFS) for the generation of random mazes in the C language.

For the graphical aspect, I used the external library ncurses, which allows to visualize the created mazes and execute user commands (moving up, down, left, right) and display the movements on the maze.
